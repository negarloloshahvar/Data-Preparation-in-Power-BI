# DataCamp-Data-Preparation-in-Power-BI
In this interactive Power BI course, I'll practice how to use Power Query Editor to transform and shape the data to be ready for analysis. I will also get to grips with various text and numerical transformations, including multiplication, rounding, and split and merge text columns, to become even more efficient in data preparation.

## Chapter 1: Profiling the Data and Introduction to Power Query

Data preparation is key to becoming a successful data analyst. We’ll learn how to do essential data preparation steps such as filtering and renaming columns and how to use data preview in Power BI to identify common errors that appear in datasets

## Chapter 2: Data Preview features in Power Query

In this chapter, we will learn about the key data preview features available through Power Query and how they can help us summarize the characteristics of the dataset. We’ll also understand how investigating the dataset in Power Query can assist in determining the data transformation steps we need to take.

## Chapter 3: Data Manipulation

The preparation and transformation of text data can also be carried out through Power Query. Through interactive exercises, we’ll learn about some of the most common text transformations, such as how to split and merge text columns, trim unwanted characters from any text data, and prefixes to any text data in the dataset.
